# README

Members of the [OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/)
create and manage technical content in this TC GitHub repository as part of the TC's chartered work 
(i.e., the program of work and deliverables described in its 
[charter](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/charter.php).

OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in [GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work)
are governed by the OASIS [TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process), 
[IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), and other policies, similar to 
TC Wikis, TC JIRA issues tracking instances, TC SVN/Subversion repositories, etc. While they make use of 
public GitHub repositories, these TC GitHub repositories are distinct from 
[OASIS Open Repositories](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories), which are used 
for development of open source [licensed content](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses).

## Description

Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control 
of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying 
products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. An Intrusion 
Detection System (IDS) is a security function for real-time traffic monitoring and inspection for 
detecting patterns of misuse in network traffic. This OpenC2 Actuator Profile defines the Actions, 
Targets, Specifiers and Options that are consistent with the version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language 
Specification (OpenC2-Lang-v1.0) in the context of command and control of IDS functionality.
